There are a few action sequences that are worthwhile and Jeff Goldblum has a few great one-liners (\\u201cYou made a promise to a dinosaur?\\u201d), but the film is a monumental disappointment overall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film has already made over $415 million at the worldwide box office, so the interest in the franchise is still there. But the chemistry between the cast is almost non-existent and it feels like the film is running on fumes as it tries to offer something new from what is otherwise dried up fossil fuel. If the _Jurassic Park/Jurassic World_ franchise is to continue, it desperately needs to go in a refreshing and unseen direction. Now that all of the nostalgia is out of the way, fans deserve a refreshing and unique adventure over what is otherwise a glorified rehash.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Jurassic-World-Dominion-2022-Review-You-Cant-Squeeze-Fun-From-a-Fossil\",\n          \"Ridiculous plot, but very enjoyable nonetheless.\\r\\n\\r\\n<em>'Some Like It Hot'</em> is good, unserious fun. Tony Curtis (Joe) and Jack Lemmon (Jerry) are the stars of the show, with amusing performances from start-to-finish. Marilyn Monroe is pleasant too, this is actually the first film of Monroe's I've seen. A good'un!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pacing isn't perfect but that doesn't hamper things at all really. It's a bonkers 122 minutes, filled with entertaining shenanigans - the ending is particularly wacky. Don't think I would've liked it as well without Curtis & Lemmon, admittedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorth watching, without question.\",\n          \"I think that _Insidious_ might genuinely be a franchise best watched in the story's chronological order, rather than the movies' release dates. I can't be certain though, because I'd have to re-watch them all to make sure I'm not making a bad recommendation, and I'm not super keen on doing that seeing as this one and the one preceding it were both kinda... bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mythology of _Insidious_ is something I am very interested in, and _The Last Key_ added it to it **somewhat**. But if this is the sort of quality we can expect from future instalments, then maybe we should never see the resolution of the same cliffhanger ending that they've given us for **the last three movies in a row**.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Final rating:\\u2605\\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2.116384932916635,\n        \"min\": 0.5,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7.0,\n          2.5,\n          5.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
